### Chandra, Fetter-Pruneda, Oxley, Ritger, McKenzie, Libbrecht, Kronauer (2018) Social regulation of insulin signaling and the evolution of eusociality in ants
- The underlying question is: what is regulating social organisation in the ants.
- Methods: 7 ant species brain comparative transcriptomics; focus on single-copy ortholgous genes; relaxed statistical stringency in association tests. Checking result using hormone antibody staining, colony alterning experiments (removing larvae, measuring brain gene expression), injecting hormone in ant (measuring reproduction capacity),
- Findings: Insulin-like peptide 2 is always upregulated in reproductives (this hormone is associated with reproduction and food); colonies without larvae see increase of gene expression of ilp2 in brain; injected hormones increase capability to reproduce; intercastes have more hormone than workers.

### Sumner, Bell and Taylor (2018) A molecular concept of caste in insect societies
- Caste is well defined in social groups differentiated by morphology; but less so in more plastic societies (simple eusocial societies) 
- Literature has many examples and many definitions based on function, activity duration and behaviour (Table 1)
- Recent debate on eusocial species = superorganisms (Boomsma and Gawne 2017, gives a historical review of the concepts from Wilson and onwards, focuses on the point of non-return/morphological castes)
- defining castes is a complicated business (cooperative breeders, variable role during life, variable expression depending on climate)
- the definition needs clearer description, including social parameters, ecological varables and molecular processes (Figure 1: physiology, morhology, behaviour, gene expression, gene regulation, functionality)
- gene expression difference between castes is stronger in more defined societies
- there are cases of castes differentiation when analysing regulatory mechanisms (epigenetic mechanisms of MicroRNAs; methylation/addition of methyltransferases associated with variaiton of gene expression, chromatin modification associated with histone port-translational modifications)
